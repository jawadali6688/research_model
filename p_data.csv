treatment of primary raynauds syndrome with traditional chinese acupuncture,"objective. evaluation of the effects of a standardized acupuncture treatment in primary raynauds syndrome. design. a controlled randomized prospective study. setting. a winter period of 23 weeks, angiological clinic of hannover medical school. subjects. thirtythree patients with primary raynauds syndrome 16 control, 17 treatment. interventions. the patients of the treatment group were given seven acupuncture treatments during the weeks 10 and 11 of the observation period. main outcome measures. all patients kept a diary throughout the entire observation period noting daily frequency, duration and severity of their vasospastic attacks. a local cooling test combined with nailfold capillaroscopy was performed for all patients at baseline week 1 and in weeks 12 and 23, recording flowstop reactions of the nailfold capillaries. results. the treated patients showed a significant decrease in the frequency of attacks from 1.4 day1 to 0.6 day1, p < 0.01 control 1.6 to 1.2, p = 0.08. the overall reduction of attacks was 63% control 27%, p = 0.03. the mean duration of the capillary flowstop reaction decreased from 71 to 24 s week 1 vs. week 12, p = 0.001 and 38 s week 1 vs. week 23, p = 0.02 respectively. in the control group the changes were not significant. conclusions. these findings suggest that traditional chinese acupuncture is a reasonable alternative in treating patients with primary raynauds syndrome.",included
a randomized controlled trial of acupressure for the treatment of rraynauds phenomenon the difficulty of conducting a trial in raynauds phenomenon,"objective to examine the effect of acupressure on raynauds phenomenon rp in a randomized controlled clinical trial rct and to evaluate the difficulties of conducting an rp rct. methods a pilot singlecenter rct of acupressure versus targeted patient education was conducted for the treatment of rp. patients with either primary n = 15 or secondary n = 8 rp were randomized in an 8week study. the primary endpoints included a decrease in the frequency and duration of rp. secondary endpoints included several serum biomarkers including endothelial dysfunction, raynauds attack symptoms, raynauds condition score, and patient and physician global assessments of rp. primary data analysis was conducted using the last observation carried forward and itests or a wilcoxon rank test was used to compare the two groups. results twentythree patients were randomized and seven discontinued prematurely. seventyeight percent of patients were female, 96% were caucasian, and the mean age was 49.8 sd = 16 years. no statistically significant differences were detected between the acupressure versus education groups in primary and secondary outcomes p>0.05. frequency of attacks decreased by 6.7 attacks sd = 8.8 in the acupressure group versus 7.2 sd = 12.8 in the education group p = 0.96, and the duration of attacks decreased by 11.4 sd = 19.9 minutes in the acupressure group versus an increase of 0.8 minutes sd = 11.2 in the education group p = 0.14. there were no adverse events noted in the rct. conclusions this pilot study does not support efficacy of acupressure for rp. trial registration clinicaltrials.gov identifier nct01784354. httpsclinicaltrials.govct2shownct01784354term =acupressure&rank=15. copyright â© 2016 wichtig international.",included
acupressure for the treatment of raynauds phenomenon a pilot randomized controlled trial,"backgroundpurpose raynauds phenomenon rp affects approximately 10% of the us population. the high cost, lack of efficacy, and side effects of conventional medical therapies necessitates the need for complementary or alternative options. objectives a pilot, randomized control trial rct of acupressure vs. patient education for the treatment of rp. methods a pilot singlecenter rct of vasodilation acupressure, relaxation acupressure vs. rp education obtained from the raynauds association control. patients with either primary n = 15 or secondary n = 8 rp were randomized from january through april by block randomization to the 3 groups for an 8 week period. patients randomized to acupressure were instructed on how to selfperform at home by a single investigator and a dvd was provided with instructions. the primary endpoint was a decrease in the severity, frequency and duration of rp. all patients kept a daily raynauds diary, recording the number and duration of attacks, pain, tingling and numbness on a 0100 scale, and daily raynauds condition score. at baseline and 8 weeks, endopat was performed to determine endothelial function, and serum was collected for biomarker analysis vegf, tpa, seselectin, bfgf, vcam1, icam. data analysis was conducted using the last observation carried forward and paired statistical analyses were used to assess difference. results 23 patients were randomized and 9 discontinued prematurely 5 patients withdrew due to time restraints, 2 each for unrelated medical problems and lost to followup. since there was no statistical difference between acupressure groups, they were combined and compared to the education group. 78% of patients were female, 96% were caucasian, the mean age was 49.8 sd=16 yrs; 516 patients in the acupressure group had secondary rp and 17 in the control group had secondary rp.. there was no statistical difference in the baseline characteristics between the acupressure groups vs. the control group. at the end of study, there were no statistical differences between the acupressure vs. education groups. however, there were trends in the patient reported severity of rp favoring acupressure groups table. in addition there were no significant differences in endopat measurements or serum markers of vasculopathy. sensitivity analysis using the completers showed similar results. table presented conclusions our pilot rct showed that acupressure groups showed trends in improvement in symptoms associated with rp. however, there were no differences in the endothelial function and serum markers of vasculopathy. the parameters used to evaluate patients with rp have marked variability and supports the need for a composite measure to be developed for rp trials.",included
is there a vasospasmolytic effect of acupuncture in patients with secondary raynaud phenomenon?,"background raynaud phenomenon rp is a vasospastic disorder of the digital arteries. severe forms are found in patients with connective tissue diseases. vasospasmolytic therapies are often limited by side effects such as orthostatic hypotension. patientsmethods we investigated therefore the effect of acupuncture in a double blind, placebocontrolled, randomized trial in patients with secondary rp. the study was performed during the winter season by licensed acupuncturists weekly for 8 weeks points chosen for the verum group l.i.4, s.j.5, st.36, p.6, du.20, ex.28. results an improvement was detected in both groups but there was no significant effect on clinical symptomsbased on patient diaries average number of attacks before and after treatment verum 1.9 + 2.0 vs. 1.4 + 1.7 attacksday and placebo 2.8 + 1.8 vs. 1.9 + 1.1; duration of attacks verum 15 + 12 vs. 12 + 9 min. and placebo 31 + 17 vs. 16 + 6; n.s. or on skin microcirculation, measured by local cold testing. conclusions a specific vasospasmolytic effect of acupuncture could not be proven. this may be due to minor morphologic changes of supplying arteries or a severe local defect in endothelial function rather than a neurological disturbance which might be influenced by acupuncture. much larger studies would be needed to identify the possible small benefit from acupuncture. if longterm relief is not obtained, it is unlikely to be costeffective.",included
efficiency of acupuncture in acral circulatory disturbances. [german],"it was our intention to analyse the effect of a vasospasmolytic acupuncture compared to a placeboacupuncture on patients with primary raynauds phenomenon rp in this randomised doubleblind study. we examined in total 19 patients with primary rp. 10 patients received verumacupuncture. 9 patients received placeboacupuncture. frequency and duration of raynauds attacks was recorded by a patients diary. the circulation was measured by capillaroscopy and laserdopplerflux during local cold exposure test. the verumpatients showed a significant improvement of the cold test parameter 86 s flow stop under cold provocation before acupuncture, 10 s after end of therapy. the placebogroup also showed improvement 71 s versus 43 s. there was no significant difference between both groups. frequency of raynauds attacks decreased from initial 7,4week to 4,2 in the verumgroup and from 5,9week to 5,4 in the placebogroup. this hemodynamic improvement was accompanied also by clinical improvement in parts of the patients regardless to verum or placebo therapy. these results show that acupuncture in the wider sense of needleinsertion therapy causes an improvement of symptoms in primary rp. however, there was no significant correlation with the use of traditional acupuncture sites.",included
efficacy of tadalafil in raynauds phenomenon secondary to systemic sclerosis a double blind randomized placebo controlled parallel group multicentric study,"objective to evaluate the efficacy of tadalafil in raynauds phenomenon rp secondary to systemic sclerosis ssc. methods patients with scleroderma as per acr criteria having >=4 raynauds attacksweek were randomized to receive either placebo or tadalafil 20 mg on alternate days as addontherapy to their current vasodilators for eight weeks. primary end points were improvement in rp parameters daily frequency, duration and raynauds condition score [rcs] and healing of existing digital ulcers du. secondary outcome measures were appearance of new du and improvement in scleroderma specific health assessment questionnaire shaq and quality of life qol indices. results we conducted a multicenter, randomized, placebocontrolled study with a 1week runin period to determine baseline severity, followed by a 8week doubleblind treatment phase. fifty three patients 26 limited, 27 diffuse ssc, 50 females with mean age 36.8 years and mean disease duration 62.8 months were recruited in the study. all the patients were receiving vasodilators calcium channel blockers n=38, angiotensin receptor blockers n=16, angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors n=8 and a combination of two vasodilators n=13. twenty six patients were randomized to placebo and 27 to tadalafil arm. baseline frequency, duration and severity of rp were not different between the two groups. improvement in mean daily frequency, mean daily duration of rp and mean daily rcs was significant in the tadalafil group p<0.001, <0.001, <0.05, respectively, placebo p=0.77, 0.821, 0.209, respectively as compared to the baseline rp parameters. the mean change in daily frequency p=0.01, duration p=0.063 and severity p=0.039 of rp was significantly better in the tadalafil group as compared to placebo group. eighteen patients in the tadalafil group had du as compared to 13 patients in the placebo group at baseline. following treatment, du healed completely in 1418 patients in the tadalafil group as compared to 513 patients in the placebo group p=0.026. new du appeared in one patient in the tadalafil group as compared to 9 patients in the placebo group p=0.004. questions related to dyspnea q2, raynauds phenomenon q4 and digital ulcers q5 of shaq improved significantly in the tadalafil group. adverse events ae were similar between the two groups. no serious ae was observed. conclusions tadalafil as addon therapy improves symptoms of rp, heals the existing du and prevent new du in patients with scleroderma.",excluded
clinical and serologic predictors of response in rituximabtreated refractory adult and juvenile dermatomyositis dm and adult polymyositis pmthe rim study,"backgroundpurpose the rituximab in myositis rim study evaluated 200 refractory myositis patients treated with rituximab, 83% of whom met the definition of improvement doi. the aim of this study was to identify the clinical and laboratory predictors of response in this cohort. methods all patients failed corticosteroids and at least 1 other immunosuppressive is agent and received rituximab at weeks 01 early or 89 late. the 1degree endpoint in this 44week trial was time to achieve doi [>=20% improvement in 3 of 6 core set measures csm includes manual muscle testing mmt, muscle enzymes, haq, patientparent global, physician global disease activity and extramuscular disease activity with no >2 csm worsening by >=25% excluding mmt] at 2 consecutive visits. we analyzed the effect of the following baseline variables on the time to doi myositis subtype, demographics, laboratory [igm, igg, myositisassociated autoantibodies maa, cbc, creatinine], damage measures global, muscle damage and atrophy and organrelated, disease activity and other clinical parameters skeletalgipulmonarymuscle disease activity, raynaud, calcinosis, mechanic hands, csm, medication early vs. late rituximab, is agents and corticosteroids and maa subset [antisynthetase antisyn, mi2, srp, tif1>, mj, other autoantibodies and those without an maa]. the wilcoxon test was used to univariately evaluate the association of baseline variables with the time to doi. a multivariate timedependent proportional hazard model was built using forward selection >=0.05 based on univariate variables with p<0.1. results 200 randomized patients 76 pm76 dm48 jdm were analyzed 96 early104 late. table 1 lists the baseline variables which predicted time to doi univariately. the multivariate model included autoantibodies antisyn was the best doi predictor followed by mi2 as compared to the no maa subset, and global damage lower damage had a better response. the effects of global damage diminished by week 20. myositis subtype jdm had a better response than adult myositis was not statistically significant univariately, however, final model was stratified by the subtypes due to their clinical relevance and post hoc had statistical significance in multivariate models. table presented conclusions antisyn and mi2 autoabs strongly predicted improvement in rituximabtreated refractory myositis patients. jdm and lower disease damage predicted more rapid improvement early in course of treatment. it is unclear whether this effect is due to a delayed beneficial effect of rituximab in patients with higher damage and adult pmdm. these results suggest that early, more aggressive therapy could be considered in some clinical and serologic myositis subsets to achieve a better therapeutic response and to avoid diseaserelated damage.",excluded
temperature intolerance as a common symptom in postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome,"introduction postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome pots is a disorder of the autonomic nervous system where the body loses the functional capability to maintain the rhythm of the heart at equilibrium as the body changes positions. pots is a subset of orthostatic intolerance that is associated with the presence of excessive tachycardia on standing. it has a higher prevalence in females. thermoregulation is a function of the autonomic nervous system that controls the amount of heat loss at the periphery by regulating the peripheral blood flow and circulation. the aim of this study is to identify the correlation between temperature intolerance and pots. methods 83 patients with pots that are treated at our syncope and arrhythmia center, were randomly selected to fill a temperature intolerance questionnaire containing ""yes or no"" questions about having heat intolerance, cold intolerance, excessive sweating and the presence of medically associated conditions hypothyroidism, hyperthyroidism, anorexia, menopause, anemia, multiple sclerosis, systemic lupus erythematous, hashimotos thyroiditis, raynauds syndrome. results 57 patients out of 83 patients, are females 68.67%, n = 57, 26 are males 31.32%, n = 26. a total of 79 out of 83 95. 43% patients had temperature intolerance in general,43 52% had both cold and heat intolerance, 20 24.09% had cold intolerance alone, 16 19.27% had heat intolerance alone, 50 60.24% had excessive sweating. 16 19.2% had hypothyroidism, 1 1.2% had hyperthyroidism, 0 0% had anorexia, 2 2.4% had menopause, 14 16.8% had anemia, 0 0% with multiple sclerosis, 0 0% had systemic lupus erythematous, 4 4.8% had hashimotos thyroiditis, 11 13.25% had raynauds syndrome. conclusions this study shows a high incidence of temperature intolerance in patients with pots, which may be due to the disorder of the autonomic nervous system associated with pots. in pots patients the highest incidence is of those who are both cold and heat intolerant, therefore indicating that pots patients have a general oversensitivity to temperature.",excluded
low level laser therapy for treatment of primary and secondary raynauds phenomenon,"background we recently performed a pilot study which suggested that clinical and thermographic improvements occurred in patients with primary and secondary raynauds phenomenon rp following treatment with low level laser irradiation llli. in view of these findings, we have proceeded with a double blind, placebocontrolled study. methods forty seven patients suffering from primary or secondary rp were randomly assigned in a doubleblind manner to receive either 10 sessions of distant llli 16 f, 8 m, median age 45 years or placebo irradiation 21 f, 2 m, median age 46 years during winter months. the attack frequency of rp was measured by a diary count; its severity was assessed by means of visual analogue scale. response to cold challenge test before and after lll or placebo treatment was assessed by infrared thermography. result overall a significant reduction of the frequency as well as the severity of rp in patients with either llli frequency p < 0.0001, severity p < 0.0001 or placebo treatment frequency p < 0.0001, severity p = 0.02 was found, but patients in the llli group exhibited a statistically more significant improvement of the frequency at 6 weeks p = 0.007 and 3 months p = 0.02 and the severity p = 0.02, p = 0.04 of rp. thermographic response to cold challenge improved only in patients treated with lll but not in those treated with placebo. conclusion llli significantly lowers the frequency and severity of raynauds attacks in patients with primary and secondary rp. since this therapeutic modality is a safe, and noninvasive treatment, it might be considered as an alternative to existing therapeutic regimes.",excluded
nifedipine in the treatment of raynauds syndrome,"thirteen patients with raynauds syndrome 10 idiopathic and three with scleroderma were treated with nifedipine or placebo in a double blind crossover study. the immediate response to 20 mg nifedipine or placebo and the response to a three week course of treatment 10 mg nifedipine eight hourly were assessed by doppler mapping of digital arteries, finger pulse volume recordings, skin temperature measurements, and arterial doppler waveform analysis. in addition, the number, duration, and severity of vasospastic attacks were noted, together with patient and observer opinion of each treatment, an overall pain score, and patient preference. there was a significant reduction in the number of attacks and in linear analogue score for pain after three weeks of nifedipine. patient and observer opinion showed a significant preference for nifedipine. the objective tests, however, failed to detect any significant change in either the short or long term. this study supports the use of nifedipine for the relief of symptoms in selected patients with raynauds syndrome and implies that it may have a unique mode of action.",excluded
